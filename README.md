#Fluxo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/samuelsimoes/fluxo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/samuelsimoes/fluxo)

Fluxo is a simple, lightweight (~300LOC) and dependency free data infrastructure lib based
on [Facebook Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux) and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org). It's compatible with [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react), but you can use
with whatever you want to the view/component layer.

**Important:** this project is under development and experimental phase and because
of this many things may change.

Check the TodoMVC implementation with Fluxo on **[samuelsimoes/todomvc-fluxo](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/todomvc-fluxo)**.

##How to use

###Actions

Everything on Fluxo starts on action handlers, this action handlers are
javascript objects registered upon a name using the method `Fluxo#registerActionHandler`.

```javascript
var commentActionHandler = {
  create: function(data) {
    return data;
  }
};

Fluxo.registerActionHandler("Comment", commentActionHandler);
```

You can register action handlers with arguments that are passed to the its
`initialize` method that are invoked when it's registered.

```javascript
var commentActionHandler = {
  initialize: function (options) {
    this.myOption = options.myOption;
  }
};

Fluxo.registerActionHandler("Comment", commentActionHandler, { myOption: true });
```

To call an action you need use the method `Fluxo#callAction` with the action
handler name, the action name and the other arguments that are passed to the action.

```javascript
Fluxo.callAction("Comment", "create", { content: "This is my comment" });
```

### Stores

You hold the state of your Flux app on the store, the stores should emit an event
to the component/view layer when something change and then your view layer renders the
changes.

On Fluxo, the store is a convenient wrapper to your literal javascript objects or
array with literal objects. It resembles a simplified version of Backbone's models
and collections without server request.

You can create stores like this:

```javascript
var Comment = Fluxo.Store.extend({
  myStoreMethod: function() {
    // ...
  }
});

var comment = new Comment({ content: "This is my comment" });
```

You need update your data using the `Fluxo.Store#set` method, which emits the change
event.

```javascript
comment.set({ content: "This is my edited comment" });
```

To access your data just access the store's `data` property.

```javascript
comment.data.content
```

###CollectionStore

`Fluxo.CollectionStore` is a wrapper to your array of objects. When you create
a CollectionStore, each item of your array is wrapped on a instance of `Fluxo.Store`,
which you can change extending the `Fluxo.CollectionStore` and specifying your
store class.

Note: `Fluxo.CollectionStore` has the same methods of the `Fluxo.Store`, so you
can use methods like `set` of `Fluxo.Store`.

```javascript
var MyComments = Fluxo.CollectionStore.extend({
  store: MyComment
});
```

When a store of a collection emits a signal of change, this signal is propagated
to the collection that also emits a change signal.

###Using with React.js

You can make your React component react to changes on your store using the
`Fluxo.WatchComponent` mixin.

```jsx
var comment = new Fluxo.Store({ content: "My comment" });

var MyComponent = React.createClass({
  mixins: [Fluxo.WatchComponent],

  listenProps: ["comment"],

  render: function() {
    return <p>{this.state.comment.content}</p>;
  }
});

React.render(
  <MyComponent comment={comment} />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

To specify what store you are listening you need declare on the component's
`listenProps` property the component's prop key to your store instances. In this way,
your store data, which is generated by `toJSON` method, is placed on state on
the same prop key name.

On the example above, the content of our store is placed on component's `this.state.comment`
property.

###Events
`Fluxo.Store` and `Fluxo.CollectionStore` can emits and react on events, using the
`on` and `trigger` methods.

The `on` method accepts two arguments, the first is the event's name array
and the second is the callback.

```javascript
myStore.on(["change:name"], function () {
  alert("wow, you changed the name");
});
```

The `trigger` method accepts one argument, the array with the events names that
you want trigger. So every registered event on the events names will be triggered.

```javascript
myStore.trigger(["myCustomEvent", "change"]);
```

The CollectionStore and Store emits `change` and `change:<NAME-OF-ATTRIBUTE>` when
you set an attribute using `set` method.

The CollectionStore emits `change`, and `add` or `remove` when you add or remove
some store.

###Computed Properties

Store and CollectionStores has computed properties like Ember.js, computed
properties let you declare functions are properties that are computed in
certain events that you declare. Look the example below on a simple Store:

```javascript
var Person = Fluxo.Store.extend({
  computed: {
    fullName: ["change:firstName", "change:lastName"]
  },

  fullName: function () {
    return (this.data.firstName + " " + this.data.lastName);
  }
});

var samuel = new Person({
  firstName: "Samuel",
  lastName:  "Simões"
});

samuel.data.fullName; // => "Samuel Simões"
```

Or a more complex example on a CollectionStore:

```javascript
var Todos = Fluxo.CollectionStore.extend({
  computed: {
    doneCount: ["change"]
  },

  doneCount: function() {
    var count; // compute the done todos count...
    return count;
  }
});

var myTodos = new Todos([{ done: true }]);

myTodos.data.doneCount; // => 1
```

###Fluxo.Radio
Internally Fluxo uses it own pub/sub implementation, this is a 20 LOC implementation.
Feel free to use on your app. The usage is very simple.

```javascript
// Create the event and store the "canceler" on a variable
var cancel = Fluxo.Radio.subscribe("alertMessage", function(message) {
  alert(message);
});

// Call the event
Fluxo.Radio.publish("alertMessage", "Hello!");

// Cancel the event
cancel();
```

###Mixins
Store and StoreCollection support mixins, the usage is identical to React mixins.

```javascript
var MyMixin = {
  sayHello: function () {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

var Comment = Fluxo.Store.extend({
  mixins: [MyMixin]
});
```
